Healthcare Data Analytics Project

Project Overview

This project simulates a healthcare data environment by generating synthetic practitioner and patient encounter data. The goal is to build a reproducible pipeline for healthcare data analysis using modern data tools, and to perform advanced SQL-based analytics to gain insights that would typically support healthcare operations, quality improvement, and clinical reporting.

Data Sources

The dataset is generated using Python, Faker, and NumPy, I took insipiration from CMS dataset. It simulates:

 Patient demographics (age, gender)
 Encounter data (encounter type, health procedures, total visits)
 Practitioner information (department, license, NPI number, clinic details)
 Practitioner employment data (status, employment start date)

Approximately 100,000 rows were generated and loaded into an SQLite database.

Tools Used

 SQLite: Lightweight, file-based relational database for initial storage and querying.
 DBeaver: SQL client used for data exploration and query development.
 Python (Pandas, Faker): Data generation and loading into SQLite.
 Tableau: Visualization and dashboarding to communicate insights.
 SQL: Advanced querying including Window Functions and Common Table Expressions (CTEs).

Database Schema

Currently, the project uses a single denormalized table called `practitioner_encounters`. In future iterations, this will be normalized into:

practitioner
patient
encounter

Key Analysis Performed

Exploratory Data Analysis

 Patient visit frequency distribution
 Practitioner workload (unique patient count per practitioner)
 Encounter trends by department
 Average patient age by encounter type
 Identification of inactive practitioners with active encounters (data quality check)


Tableau Dashboards

Several dashboards were built in Tableau using an exported version of the dataset:

 Practitioner Workload by Department
 Patient Visit Frequency Histogram
 Encounter Volume Over Time
 Active vs Inactive Practitioner Engagement
