### Example SQL Queries

#### Patient Visit Frequency

```sql
SELECT patient_id, COUNT(*) AS visit_count
FROM practitioner_encounters
GROUP BY patient_id
HAVING visit_count > 5
ORDER BY visit_count DESC;
```

#### Average Patient Age by Encounter Type

```sql
SELECT encounter_type, AVG(patient_age) AS avg_age
FROM practitioner_encounters
GROUP BY encounter_type;
```

#### Practitioner Panel Size Using Window Function

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
    practitioner_id,
    practitioner_first_name,
    practitioner_last_name,
    COUNT(DISTINCT patient_id) OVER (PARTITION BY practitioner_id) AS panel_size
FROM practitioner_encounters;
```

#### Monthly Encounter Volume Using CTE and Window Function

```sql
WITH monthly_encounters AS (
    SELECT
        STRFTIME('%Y-%m', employment_start_date) AS encounter_month,
        COUNT(*) AS total_encounters
    FROM practitioner_encounters
    GROUP BY encounter_month
)
SELECT *,
    SUM(total_encounters) OVER (ORDER BY encounter_month ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS running_total
FROM monthly_encounters;
```

#### Practitioners with No Recent Encounters (Last 1 Year Example CTE)

```sql
WITH recent_encounters AS (
    SELECT practitioner_id, MAX(employment_start_date) AS last_encounter_date
    FROM practitioner_encounters
    GROUP BY practitioner_id
)
SELECT p.practitioner_id, p.practitioner_first_name, p.practitioner_last_name, r.last_encounter_date
FROM recent_encounters r
JOIN practitioner_encounters p ON p.practitioner_id = r.practitioner_id
WHERE r.last_encounter_date < DATE('now', '-1 year');
```
